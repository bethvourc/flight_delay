# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning models to predict flight delays based on various features such as flight number, airline, weather conditions, and more. The goal is to build a model that can assist airlines and passengers in understanding the potential delays before their flights.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various details about flights, such as:

- Flight times
- Carrier details
- Weather conditions
- Delays (carrier, weather, security, etc.)

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   The raw flight data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning. Missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features are handled.

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   New features are created from the available data to better capture the underlying patterns that influence flight delays.

3. **Modeling**:  
   The project utilizes different machine learning models, including:
   - XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
   - Logistic Regression (for classification tasks)
   
   Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the models' performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, and other metrics. Cross-validation is used to ensure robust results.

5. **Visualization**:  
   Various plots are generated to visualize the results, such as the confusion matrix, feature importance, and ROC curves.

## Usage

To execute the project, run the Jupyter notebook `flight_delay.ipynb`. The notebook includes all the code necessary to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and evaluate the models, and visualize the results.

### Example:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')

# Train the model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('Delay', axis=1), df['Delay'], test_size=0.2)
model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Results

The models' performance is assessed based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. The insights obtained can help in forecasting flight delays, thus allowing passengers to make better decisions about their travel plans.
